## Skcript Logos

This repo contains versions of our logo and the icons of the company and products we create. Feel free to use these anywhere on the web with the guidelines we have set to protect the brand identity.

- Do not modify or alter Skcript logo
- Do not use it in any confusing way
- Do not use it in places where the team has not authorized in terms of sponsorship for events or endorsements.
- You can view the rest of the braning guidelines [here.](https://github.com/skcript/skcript-logos/blob/master/Do's%20and%20Don'ts/Dos_and_Donts.md)

We deeply care about our brand, and we believe that you make use of our logo whenever necessary in appropriate places. If you find someone abusing our logo, or violating the guidelines, please write to us at [bello@skript.com](mailto:bello@skcript.com)
